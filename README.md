# gradebook-tool

What the program does: 

This gradebook-tool program takes in user input, specifically the student's full name and grade. With this information being stored in a dictionary, the user is then prompted to 6 different options including adding another student,
calculating the statistics of the grades (such as min grade, max grade, and the average class grade). The user is also offered to display each student's numeric grade as a letter grade. If the user wants to save this information they are given the option to do so as well where this information is written into a file. The user can then also choose to calculate the stats from the saved file, where it is displayed to them. 


Steps to run it:

1. Have Python 3.x installed on your system
   
3. Clone the repo to your system
   
5. Run the program (in bash):  python student_gradebook.py
   
7. Follow the prompts
